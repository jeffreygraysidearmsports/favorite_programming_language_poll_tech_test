# favorite_programming_language_poll_tech_test
iOS Tech Test

Thank you for your interest in the iOS Developer position at SIDEARM Sports!

## We would love seeing your iOS/Swift knowledge in action.:
Could you create a small app for us using the following requirements? 

This repo contains a blank XCode project for you to start with.

The app should be a single screen that contains a 3 question poll. 

It should have the question "What is your favorite programming language?" 

It should have the following choices:

Swift
Java
Kotlin

There should be a button to submit your answer.  

Below that, there should be another button that pops up a modal window that displays number of votes for each choice.

If you could then commit and push your code back to the repo for us to review, we'd appreciate it! 
## What Comes Next: 

If we like what we see, we will bring you back in to go over your code.
